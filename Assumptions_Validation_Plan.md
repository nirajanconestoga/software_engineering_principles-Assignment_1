## Assumptions & Validation Plan

### Assumptions:
These assumptions are based on the initial interview. They need to be validated during the upcoming meeting:
1. New employees currently lack structured onboarding documents or materials, which leads to inconsistent training.
2. Clients do not have access to a guided signup system, making onboarding confusing.
3. Clients may not fully understand the daycare’s policies and procedures before signing up, leading to misunderstandings later.
4. There are no clear performance metrics that measure onboarding success.
5. The daycare does not use automation to assist with onboarding, leading to delays.
6. Employees and clients are willing to adapt to a standardized onboarding process.
7. New employees receive minimal formal training and rely heavily on peer guidance.
8. Clients expect a seamless, digital onboarding experience but currently face a largely manual process.
9. There are frequent miscommunications between employees and clients due to unclear procedures.
10. The current existing onboarding materials are outdated and not updated to the daycare’s specific needs.

### Validation Plan:
1. Conduct in-depth discussions with all the employees, either newly hired or experienced, to verify training gaps.
2. Review existing client onboarding materials and methods with the client.
3. Analyze feedback from past employees and clients regarding onboarding.
4. Compare the onboarding period and efficiency with industry standards.
5. Test a suggested standardized process with a small group before full implementation.
